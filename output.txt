#######################################


Year: 1350
There lived a village in the outskirts of the Astodia Kingdom.
The village was considered to be mankind's last stand against the Demon Lord.
You see five years ago, the Demon Lord launched an all out attack upon the Astodia Kingdom.
However the Astodia Kingdom was unable to fend off against the Demon Lord's assault.
And with that, the Astodia Kingdom fell into the hands of the Demon Lord.
The village composes of the remaining survivors that were able to escape during the attack.
Red was one of the survivors that were able to escape but unfortunately, the same couldn't have been said about their family.
Red vowed that once they reached level 18, they'd set off to the forest heading to the old ruins of the Astodia Kingdom to find and kill the Demon Lord.
Red will start training today to become stronger.
So Red decided to exist their house.

As Red was exploring through the forest, Red was able to discover the old ruin Kingdom of Astodia that's now being ruled over by the Demon Lord.
Should Red fight with the Demon Lord now? (YOU CANNOT GO BACK ONCE YOU HAVE SAID YES) (1 = no, 2 = yes): 2

Red carefully enters castle of the ruin Kingdom.
So far, Red could see no sign of life at all. Perhaps the Demon lord had abandoned this place.
As soon as that thought crossed their mines, a loud explosion occurred at the end of the hallway.
As the smoke started to clear, Red could see a shadowy figure begin to emerge

There stood the Demon Lord. The same one that launch the attack upon this Kingdom all those years ago.
Neither Red nor the Demon Lord exchanged any words. For they both knew that only one of them was leaving here alive.
